# **Calculator App**

A simple, yet powerful calculator application built with React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. This project leverages modern tools like Vite for fast builds and Vitest for unit testing.

## **Features**

- **Basic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Convert the current value into a percentage.
- **Plus/Minus Toggle (`Â±`)**: Toggle the sign of the current input value.
- **Parentheses Support**: Add parentheses to group operations and control the order of evaluation.
- **Backspace Functionality**: Remove the last digit or character in the current input.
- **Chained Calculations**: Display all operations and operands as they are entered, updating the result dynamically.
- **Responsive UI**: Tailored for both desktop and mobile devices with a clean and intuitive interface built using Tailwind CSS.

## **Technologies Used**

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A standardized way to write Redux logic, with powerful utilities for efficient state management.
- **Vite**: A next-generation front-end tool that offers instant server start, lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized builds.
- **Vitest**: A blazing-fast unit testing framework compatible with Vite, providing an easy way to write and run unit tests.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup.
